# CS50AI-Project1-Knights
My solution for CS50AI project 0 - knights.

An program which solves the logic puzzle of the game 'Kinghts and Knaves'.

In Knights and Knaves, each character is either a Knight or a Knave.  
Knights will always tell the truth, whereas Knaves will always lie.

Given a set of sentences spoken by various characters, the objective of the game is to determine which characters are Knights and which characters are Knaves.

The AI uses propositional symbols and knowledge bases to determine which characters are Knights and which are Knaves.
